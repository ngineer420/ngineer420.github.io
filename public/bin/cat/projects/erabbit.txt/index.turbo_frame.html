    <h1>Project: eRabb.it</h1>

    A terminal-esque web profile

    <h2>Stack</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>- CSS: Tailwind</li>
      <li>- DevOps: Vite</li>
      <li>- JS: Turbo + Stimulus</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Objective</h2>

    To use Turbo Frames to create a UX that behaved like a terminal with as little custom JS as practical, and with no backend what-so-ever.

    <h2>Benefits</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>- Generates static HTML for consistently fast page loads</li>
      <li>- Sends HTML-over-the-wire for fast, dynamic page updates</li>
      <li>- Adds very little custom JS so the application overhead remains low</li>
      <li>- Doesn't utilize a backend server or database so the entire application can be hosted for free on GitHub pages</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Drawbacks</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>- With no backend nor any build tools to generate the HTML itself, the approach forces a trade-off between DRY-templating and superfluous requests. Opted for the latter as these typically produce 304s from the browser, and/or are fast and free. This would not be necessary if using a static site generator, like Jekyll - I may opt into this added complexity should the project grow in scope at a later point.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Easter Eggs</h2>

    Homage has been paid in some form or other to the following:

    <ul>
      <li>- The Net, if you discovered a poorly hidden way here</li>
      <li>- The Matrix, if you "followed" your way here</li>
      <li>- Jurassic Park, if you didn't use the magic word</li>
      <li>- Stephen King's "The Dark Tower" series, if you looked closely</li>
    </ul>
