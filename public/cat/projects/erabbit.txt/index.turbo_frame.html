    <h1>Project: eRabb.it</h1>

    A terminal-esque web profile

    <h2>Stack</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>- CSS: Tailwind</li>
      <li>- DevOps: Vite</li>
      <li>- JS: Turbo + Stimulus</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Objective</h2>

    To use Turbo Frames to create a UX that behaved like a terminal with as little custom JS as practical, and with no backend what-so-ever.

    <h2>Benefits</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>- Generates static HTML for consistently fast page loads</li>
      <li>- Sends HTML-over-the-wire for fast, dynamic page updates</li>
      <li>- Adds very little custom JS so the application overhead remains low</li>
      <li>- Doesn't utilize a backend server or database so the entire application can be hosted for free on GitHub pages</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Drawbacks</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>- With no backend, forces a trade-off between DRY-templating and superfluous requests. Opted for the latter as these typically produce 304s from the browser, and/or are fast and free. These templates can be found in the /public/application directory.</li>
    </ul>
